# EQ2Voice Recovery Project BOINC Application - **PROTOTYPE BUILD**

**LINUX/WINDOWS SUPPORT ONLY AT THIS TIME**

This is released for the sake of being open about what our code is doing for the BOINC project and please keep in mind the adhoc process it was put together, back in 2020 by LethalEncounter and the new integration to BOINC by Image/Emagi in 2023.

Visit http://boinc.eq2emu.com/cplan/ for more project details.  This BOINC Application is used inside the EQ2 Voice Recovery project in attempt to brute force RC4 64-bit encryption keys used on MP3 NPC Voices.
