What comes in must go out, therefore while the aqueducts brought water into the city, the drains enable it to leave, without making the city's streets impossible to navigate safely -- or cleanly.")

Much of the Vermin's Snye area is in the Randalphesque style, with generally plain columns supporting plaster and lathe ceilings.  This early architecture was a ''back-to-our-roots'' reaction to the cataclysms reshaping the world, when people wanted simple yet homey structures.")
