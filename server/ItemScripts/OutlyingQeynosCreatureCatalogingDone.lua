The Bog in particular is an area where seasons of growth have compacted upon dense, moist soil and the scent of decay in that section would make living there disagreeable to say the least.")

This woodland preserve is shaded by emerald green broad-leaf trees such as oak and maple. Beneath the trees, the undergrowth is scattered with trillium, bleeding hearts and red-tipped paintbrushes. On the opposite end of the spectrum is the bog, with its greenish brown earth and fallen logs.")

Amongst the usual scattering of insects and birds, one finds several fairies and sprites protecting their space, attacking all who venture too near. Additionally, the Ruins are home to some unfortunate folk who have not yet earned their eternal sleep.")
