-- No buts about it! I am not giving any information out about my sister until I know you can be trusted!
--Suspicious, me?  Uh... I was just testing you to see if you were truly interested. I am so worried about my sister but I do not want just some random person helping us find it... I mean, uh her... yes, her is what I meant.
