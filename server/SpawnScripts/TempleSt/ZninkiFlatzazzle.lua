See, if I clink this tuning fork like this, the Locator rockets the thief a mile into the air, where he suddenly explodes in a spectacular burst of blood ... making him much easier to locate.  Ah-ha!  You see that red cloud up there?  That must be the goblin who took my Bread Bisector!  Oh, I simply must retrieve it!
--Would you?  That would be most satisfactory!  Why yes, I like that idea very much.  I shall eagerly await the return of my ingenious device â€“ the Bread Bisector!
--I've found the Bread Bisector on one of the a Blackshield pillagers.

--My Bread Bisector!  My beautiful Bread Bisector!  I'll never rest until it's returned to me!

--I've managed to find the Bread Bisector, which looks awfully similar to a knife.
--It's no ordinary knife, my friend.  It's the Bread Bisector!  See, you take an ordinary loaf of bread and, using the Bisector, you slice it in twain!  And if you adjust this little knob here, you can bisect it many many times over ... creating "slices."  Have you ever seen the like?
