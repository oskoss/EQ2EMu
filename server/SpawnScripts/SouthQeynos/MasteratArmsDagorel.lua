Warriors run to the front line in battle and care only about slaughtering the enemy and oiling their weapons with their foe's blood.  Warriors know might makes right.  Do you choose this path?
None matches the conviction of a crusader. Crusaders fight for a cause. This cause gives them the strength to crush their opponents beneath their feet. The last thing that people see when they fight a crusader is a cold, dead look -- their own reflection in the crusader's eyes.  Do you choose this path?
]]--


--[FINAL SELECTION] 
--You have to make a choice!  You got potential, you do, and it would be a sore shame to see you waste it!  But you can't be a fighter your entire life. You gotta focus on one of the styles I showed you, if you wanna go places.  So what will it be, eh?



--Brawlers use their brains, they do. They don't need armor if their enemies can't hit 'em.  They also know they can't be disarmed if they have built-in weapons. Well, they can, but that' messy business that we don't need to discuss. So, are ya willin' to push yourself to the limit as a brawler?
--Brawlers don't waste their time strapping on bulky armor. Sometimes the only weapons they use are their fists, and they dodge their opponent's blows with the swiftness of a hawk.  Do you choose this path?
--If you're a true brawler, you need to undergo a challenge.  In order to join the ranks of the brawlers here in Qeynos, you gotta prove your skills. Enter the dojo and go fist to fist against another brawler.  If you manage to defeat 'em, you'll become that which you seek.

--Thank you, Dagorel.  I won't forget your lessons.
--Aye, aye.  The watchmen informed me. They say you held your own. That's what I want to hear! You had to prove your fightin' skills--I don't want anyone accusing ol' Dagorel of sending ill-equipped kids off to their deaths. You proved you got what it takes, kid. Good work.

--Yes.  I will train everyday to master the art of pugilism.  I am a brawler.
--I like relying on my fists in battle. I want to be a brawler.
--
--Understand one more thing as well ...  when you defeat your last opponent, meditate at the altar in the dojo.  A brawler is not only strong of body but also of mind.  Strengthening both is mandatory.  Once you do this, you'll have proven yourself.

--BRAWLER ALTAR A cool breeze swirls around you, sending a tingle up the back of your spine.  You arise from the altar and know in your soul that you are a brawler.
--CRUSADER START It's not as easy as that, youngin'.  You don't just declare yourself a crusader, or did you learn nothing from my previous lessons?  No, crusader is a title earned by those with enough heart to consider the fair city of Qeynos and its inhabitants first and themselves a distant second.

--I like having a commanding presence in battle. I want to be a crusader.
--
--Though all warriors fight for a cause, none have as strong a conviction as a crusader. Crusaders live to fight another day ... and another ... and another... They never stop, for they know their next opponent waits to take everything they've earned.
--It's not as easy as that, youngin'.  You don't just declare yourself a crusader, or did you learn nothing from my previous lessons?  No, crusader is a title earned by those with enough heart to consider the fair city of Qeynos and its inhabitants first and themselves a distant second.
--Yes.  I prefer to take care of a problem, rather than let it take care of me.  I am a warrior!
--Whoa, now! Not yet, you're not!  You have to prove you can last in the fray. You didn't think I'd wave a magic wand and make you a warrior, did you?  No, no, we got a make shift arena set up in the warehouse, where you'll prove yourself, a true warrior of Qeynos. No need to return to me, I've taught you all I can.
