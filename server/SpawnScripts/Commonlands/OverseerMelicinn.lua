I have seen a ghost within that graveyard that has been bound to this world for as long as the graveyard has been there.  I believe that ghost was one of Zarvonn's first undead to be raised.  Patiently wait for it to rise, destroy it, and bring back its ectoplasmic residue.  With that residue, I can examine the magic used to raise it... which might allow me to unlock the mystery of this stone.")
